# spatialsegregation
An R package of functional summaries useful for analysing multitype point patterns, mainly motivated by biodiversity analysis. 

## Highlights

Global and local versions of

* Shannon index
* Simpson index
* Mingling -''-
* Mean Compositional index

Also

* ISAR i.e. count of alien types around 'average point' of chosen type
* Dixon's test
* Biomass sums, weighted ISAR

Local versions support the usual "upto distance r" as well as "k-nearest",  Gabriel and Delaunay graphs.
